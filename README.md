Multi-label disaster text classification via supervised contrastive learning for social media data
Social media is a crucial way to release information timely during disasters, which can effectively help people understand the disaster situation and provide rescue information for people in the disaster environment.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.
1) We have constructed two multi-label disaster datasets for social media. The datasets depend on real disaster events, and all collect multiple types of disaster and humanitarian relief types. 
2) We propose the SCMC framework for multi-label disaster context classification, which can enhance the semantic representation of the model and improve the inference of the model. 
3) We conduct experiments on two multi-label disaster benchmark datasets. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.
